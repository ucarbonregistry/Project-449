# Project-449
9.62 MW Bundled Solar Power Project by Panoli Intermediates (India) Pvt Ltd. in Gujarat, India
___________
The project 9.62 MW Bundled Solar Power Project by Panoli Intermediates (India) Pvt Ltd. in
Gujarat, India is located in Rupnagar Village, Sami Taluka, Patan District, Sarod Village,
Jambusar Taluka, Bharuch District and Kadachala Village, Halol Taluka, Panchmahal District of
Indian State Gujarat. The project is an operational activity with continuous reduction of GHG,
currently being applied under “Universal Carbon Registry” (UCR).

Purpose of the project activity:
The purpose of the project activity is to generate electricity using a clean and renewable source of
energy i.e., solar energy. The project activity of 9.62 MW (3.75 MW 4.07 MW) was installed and
operated of solar power plant in Patan, Bharuch and Panchmahal districts in the state of Gujarat are
per details listed below:

As per the ex-ante estimate, the project will generate approximately 16,854.24 MWh of electricity
per annum. The net generated electricity from the project activity is being wheeled to
manufacturing facility of project proponent (PP) in Gujarat for captive consumption through the
Indian grid (previously known as NEWNE grid) as per wheeling agreement signed between
Madhya Gujarat Vij Company Limited (MGVCL) & Dakshin Gujarat Vij Company Limited
(DGVCL) and PP. 

The generation of power from solar photovoltaic is a clean technology as there is
no fossil fuel fired or no GHG gases are emitted during the process. Photovoltaic module consists of
several photovoltaic cells connected by circuits and sealed in an environmentally protective
laminate, which forms the fundamental building blocks of the complete PV generating unit. Thus,
project activity leads to reduce the GHG emissions as it displaces power from fossil fuel-based
electricity generation in the regional grid. 
_____________________
The estimated annual average and the total CO2e emission reduction by the project activity is
expected to be 15,168 tCO2e, whereas actual emission reduction achieved during the first CoU
period shall be submitted as a part of first monitoring and verification.
